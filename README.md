SuperChatFilter
Version 0.5.0
by Ebben Feagan

Replaces desired words from chat messages with whatever you want.
Uses regular expressions so advanced usages are possible.

Automatically kicks players who are filtered (configurable amount) and notifies staff (players with access to the kick command).
